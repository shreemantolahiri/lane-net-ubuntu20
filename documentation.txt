I ran into the same issue I think (I had the same error message trying to launch RStudio after upgrading Ubuntu from 18.04 to 20.04). Here is what worked for me after reading the following page: https://packages.ubuntu.com/xenial/amd64/libssl1.0.0/download

Edit the source list sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list to add the following line: deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial-security main
Then sudo apt update and sudo apt install libssl1.0.0.
I hope t works for you too.

I resolved this error by downgrading from opencv-python 4.5.1.48 to opencv-python 4.3.0.36 with PyQt5 5.15.2 installed.
